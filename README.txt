Title: SWE 01

Input :

Taking a System Requirements Specification (created by a requirement engineer with input from customers - Elicitation )
Hardware/Software Interface 
Requirements Management Plan
Outputs:

Software Requirements Specification:

Functional Requirements
Non-functional Requirements
Design Constraints
Real-time Constraints
Hardware/Software Interface Requirements
Safety Requirements
Security Requirements
Quality Constraints
SIQ Documents:

Using the Software Requirements Specification Document, create a Software Test Specification Document (which contains test cases).
Use both documents to check traceability for SWE 01 and SWE 02  using the AutoRTM Tool.

Quality Audit Check:

Ensure that the SRMP is perfectly defined because the SYS is written and audited using the SRMP.

Verify that the SRS is using the correct template (Legacy, Gsmart, SIPH) mentioned in the SRMP.

Ensure that every requirement mentioned in the SRS has a unique ID and check if the requirement ID has the correct name formation mentioned in the RMP.

Ensure that all attributes given in the SRS are mentioned in the RMP and that attributes have values.

For any doubts in the SRS, raise a question in the SIQ and get an answer from the respective person.


Check that all raised questions are closed.
Check that the technical review is planned and performed as per the plan.

Ensure consistency.

Ensure traceability.
Ensure communication to stakeholders as per the CM Plan.


Peer Review and Technical Review Difference : 

A peer review is a process where a product or work is reviewed by individuals who are in the same field or have similar expertise..

technical review is a more formal process that involves a detailed examination of a product or work by experts who have specialized knowledge in that area. 


Function and Non-Function Requirements Description : 

Functional requirements: These define what the software system should do, its features, and the actions it should perform. 

Non-functional requirements: These define how well the software should perform its functions, including criteria such as usability, reliability, performance, and availability. 

Design constraints: These specify limitations on how the system should be designed, including technical or environmental constraints that may affect its performance. 

Real-time constraints: These define the time limits for completing a task or responding to an event, and are often critical for systems that require immediate action.

 Hardware/software interface requirements: These define the specifications for how the software system should interact with external hardware or software systems. 

Safety requirements: These ensure that the software system is designed to operate safely and to minimize the risk of accidents or harm. 

Security requirements: These ensure that the software system is designed to protect against unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Quality constraints: These define the level of quality required for the software system, including reliability, maintainability, and scalability.
